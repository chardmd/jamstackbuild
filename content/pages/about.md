Hi, my name is [Richard](https://twitter.com/iamchardmd). I started **Jamstackbuild.com** to provide modern static web development tutorials and code snippets for aspiring developers of all levels. If you are curious about static site generators (SSG) or want to learn [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org) in general, then you found the right place.

Regardless of your skill level, all articles aim to be *simple and easy to understand.*

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at [hello@jamstackbuild.com](mailto:hello@jamstackbuild.com). Happy coding! :)
