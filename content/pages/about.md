Hi, my name is [Richard](https://twitter.com/iamchardmd). I started **Jamstackbuild.com** to provide modern static web development tutorials and code snippets for aspiring developers and experienced programmers. The web is rapidly changing away from monolithic to decoupled apps, and placing more power and capabilities in the hands of designers and front-end developers. If you are curious about static site generators or the JAMstack in general then you are in the right place.

All published articles aim to be simple and easy to understand.  Happy coding! :)
